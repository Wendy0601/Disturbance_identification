Read_me:
In the main function:
1, Two parameters (thres and gap )are used to choose rank;
2, Function 'import_data' is to import dictionary, 12 test data sets;
3, Function 'Event_Identification' is to identify event types by computing subspace angle (function 'angle0');
4, The type of the events are in the output of 'type_', and the minimum subspace angles are in 'min_angle', the original voltages are in the 'voltage' and 'Vk' represents the subspaces;
5, According to the input of the user, the results of the chosen event will be displayed. For example, if we choose 9, the results are plotted.
